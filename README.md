# React Grocery Store 

It is a project where simulated a grocery store where you can add to the cart products that you want to buy.

For this project I used

- Sass for style
- Redux toolkit to handle the actions and reducers on this project
- react router dom to buil the routes that I'm going to use for this
- Grids for organize how I'm going to display the products
- Animate.css to add some animations on this project
- Fontawesome to use some icons

In this project I used the slices (from redux-toolkit) for two reasons

- Handled the behavior of store like getting the total of products picked, how many products I selected, show the information of the products picked
- Handle the theme from light to dark and reverse

To run the project first you have to install dependecies
```
npm install
```

then to run the project you have to use this command
```
npm start
```

(Also you can install and initialize the project with yarn)
